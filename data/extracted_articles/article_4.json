(3) \u2018restriction of processing\u2019 means the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future; (4) \u2018profiling\u2019 means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluatecertainpersonalaspectsrelatingtoanaturalperson,inparticulartoanalyseorpredictaspectsconcerning that natural person\u2019s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements; Guidelines & Case Law Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679 (2018): Profiling is composed of three elements: it has to be an automated form of processing; it has to be carried out on personal data; and the objective of the profiling must be to evaluate personal aspects about a natural person. Article4(4)refersto\u2018anyformofautomatedprocessing\u2019ratherthan\u2018solely\u2019automatedprocessing(referredtoinArticle22). Profiling has to involve some form of automated processing \u2013 although human involvement does not necessarily take the activity out of the definition. Profilingisaprocedurewhichmayinvolveaseriesofstatisticaldeductions.Itisoftenusedtomakepredictionsaboutpeople, using data from various sources to infer something about an individual, based on the qualities of others who appear statistically similar. TheGDPRsaysthatprofilingisautomatedprocessingofpersonaldataforevaluatingpersonalaspects,inparticulartoanalyse or make predictions about individuals. The use of the word \u2018evaluating\u2019 suggests that profiling involves some form of assessment or judgement about a person. Asimpleclassificationofindividualsbasedonknowncharacteristicssuchastheirage,sex,andheightdoesnotnecessarily lead to profiling. This will depend on the purpose of the classification. For instance, a business may wish to classify its customersaccordingtotheirageorgenderforstatisticalpurposesandtoacquireanaggregatedoverviewofitsclientswithout makinganypredictionsordrawinganyconclusionaboutanindividual.Inthiscase,thepurposeisnotassessingindividual characteristics and is therefore not profiling. TheGDPRisinspiredbybutisnotidenticaltothedefinitionofprofilingintheCouncilofEuropeRecommendationCM/Rec (2010)132(theRecommendation),astheRecommendationexcludesprocessingthatdoesnotincludeinference.Nevertheless GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing page 5 / 18 www.gdpr-text.com/en the Recommendation usefully explains that profiling may involve three distinct stages: data collection; automated analysis to identify correlations; applying the correlation to an individual to identify characteristics of present or future behaviour. Controllers carrying out profiling will need to ensure they meet the GDPR requirements in respect of all of the above stages. Broadlyspeaking,profilingmeansgatheringinformationaboutanindividual(orgroupofindividuals)andevaluatingtheir characteristicsorbehaviourpatternsinordertoplacethemintoacertaincategoryorgroup,inparticulartoanalyseand/or make predictions about, for example, their: ability to perform a task; interests; or likely behaviour.

Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person.
