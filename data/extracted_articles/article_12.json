Transparent information, communication and modalities for the exercise of the rights of the data subject Recitals (58) The principle of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to the data subject be concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language and, additionally, where appropriate, visualisation be used. Such information could be provided in electronic form, for example, when addressed to the public, through a website. This is of particular relevance in situations where the proliferation of actors and the technological complexity of practice make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand whether,bywhomandforwhatpurposepersonaldatarelatingtohimorherarebeingcollected,suchasinthecase of online advertising.
