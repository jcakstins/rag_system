[4] Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31). https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1995:281:TOC (4)Theprocessingofpersonaldatashouldbedesignedtoservemankind.Therighttotheprotectionofpersonaldata is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects all fundamental rightsandobservesthefreedomsandprinciplesrecognisedintheCharterasenshrinedintheTreaties,inparticular the respect for private and family life, home and communications, the protection of personal data, freedom of thought,conscienceandreligion,freedomofexpressionandinformation,freedomtoconductabusiness,therightto an effective remedy and to a fair trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.

The exchange of personal data between public and private actors, includingnaturalpersons,associationsandundertakingsacrosstheUnionhasincreased.Nationalauthoritiesinthe GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing page 3 / 5 www.gdpr-text.com/en Member States are being called upon by Union law to cooperate and exchange personal data so as to be able to perform their duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an authority in another Member State.

(10) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent and homogenous applicationoftherulesfortheprotectionofthefundamentalrightsandfreedomsofnaturalpersonswithregardto theprocessingofpersonaldatashouldbeensuredthroughouttheUnion.Regardingtheprocessingofpersonaldata for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce nationalprovisionstofurtherspecifytheapplicationoftherulesofthisRegulation.Inconjunctionwiththegeneral GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing page 4 / 5 www.gdpr-text.com/en andhorizontallawondataprotectionimplementingDirective95/46/EC,MemberStateshaveseveralsector-specific lawsinareasthatneedmorespecificprovisions.ThisRegulationalsoprovidesamarginofmanoeuvreforMember Statestospecifyitsrules,includingfortheprocessingofspecialcategoriesofpersonaldata(\u2018sensitivedata\u2019).Tothat extent, this Regulation does not exclude Member State law that sets out the circumstances for specific processing situations, including determining more precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful.

Article4(4)refersto\u2018anyformofautomatedprocessing\u2019ratherthan\u2018solely\u2019automatedprocessing(referredtoinArticle22). Profiling has to involve some form of automated processing \u2013 although human involvement does not necessarily take the activity out of the definition. Profilingisaprocedurewhichmayinvolveaseriesofstatisticaldeductions.Itisoftenusedtomakepredictionsaboutpeople, using data from various sources to infer something about an individual, based on the qualities of others who appear statistically similar. TheGDPRsaysthatprofilingisautomatedprocessingofpersonaldataforevaluatingpersonalaspects,inparticulartoanalyse or make predictions about individuals. The use of the word \u2018evaluating\u2019 suggests that profiling involves some form of assessment or judgement about a person. Asimpleclassificationofindividualsbasedonknowncharacteristicssuchastheirage,sex,andheightdoesnotnecessarily lead to profiling. This will depend on the purpose of the classification. For instance, a business may wish to classify its customersaccordingtotheirageorgenderforstatisticalpurposesandtoacquireanaggregatedoverviewofitsclientswithout makinganypredictionsordrawinganyconclusionaboutanindividual.Inthiscase,thepurposeisnotassessingindividual characteristics and is therefore not profiling. TheGDPRisinspiredbybutisnotidenticaltothedefinitionofprofilingintheCouncilofEuropeRecommendationCM/Rec (2010)132(theRecommendation),astheRecommendationexcludesprocessingthatdoesnotincludeinference.Nevertheless GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing page 5 / 18 www.gdpr-text.com/en the Recommendation usefully explains that profiling may involve three distinct stages: data collection; automated analysis to identify correlations; applying the correlation to an individual to identify characteristics of present or future behaviour. Controllers carrying out profiling will need to ensure they meet the GDPR requirements in respect of all of the above stages. Broadlyspeaking,profilingmeansgatheringinformationaboutanindividual(orgroupofindividuals)andevaluatingtheir characteristicsorbehaviourpatternsinordertoplacethemintoacertaincategoryorgroup,inparticulartoanalyseand/or make predictions about, for example, their: ability to perform a task; interests; or likely behaviour.

Such information could be provided in electronic form, for example, when addressed to the public, through a website.
